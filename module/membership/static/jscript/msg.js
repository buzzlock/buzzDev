						'Payment:\nAffiliates are paid a recurring referral fee for each paid membership referred to our site. A referral is counted when a unique customer first clicks on an affiliate tracking link and completes the signup process and pays their first months monthly membership fee.\n\nAffiliate accounts must be active at the time of the referral. No referral fee will be given to your affiliate account for sales that occurred before you joined the affiliate program, or after you are terminated.\n\nMissing or untracked affiliate referrals must be reported during the current referral period. Referrals that take place and are not reported during the current period will not be credited to your account.\n\nSession/cookies length are 365 days. Also, once someone you have referred has signed up for either the free access site, a paid membership, and/or the affiliate program, they are linked to you indefinitely as long as you remain an active affiliate. So even if they initially sign up for the free access site and later become a paid member, you will then start earning your referral fees for that paid member.\n\nAffiliate referral fees are locked 15 days after the end of the month in which the credit is recorded. Payments are then processed and sent out from the 16th through the last day of the month or until all payments have been sent. EXAMPLE: Credits recorded in January will lock on the 15th of February and payments are sent after the 16th.\n\nAffiliates must earn a minimum of $50 (50 USD) before the affiliate account is eligible for payment.\n\nPayments are sent using the Payza or PayPal mass payment system (you pay the transaction fee). If you do not supply a PayPal or Payza address a check will be mailed to you. Payments by check take up to an additional 30 days to arrive. For larger affiliates with balances of over $10,000 per month we offer Wire Transfer. To update your payment information, please contact the affiliate department or go to your back office in your affiliate area online.\n\nAffiliates are responsible for ensuring that all payee information is up to date in the affiliate system. We are not responsible for lost/stolen payments. The affiliate is responsible for keeping all information up to date including postal and email addresses, name, payment information, tax information or any other personal information that will impact the ability to issue a valid payment. Failure to provide current information may result in forfeiture of any referral fees due to you. Referral fees that are left unclaimed or are returned for invalid or insufficient address information or for other reasons may be forfeited as well.\n\nThere is a $35 (35 USD) charge to re-issue payment and it will be deducted from the affiliate earnings.\n\nAffiliates are responsible for making sure they are able to accept payments. Please ensure that your bank, Payza or PayPal account can accept payments from US-based companies.\n\nAffiliates are responsible for any and all fees, taxes, exchange rates, surcharges and other expenses incurred in order to receive their referral fees. Please check with your local banking institution, Payza or PayPal to find out if any of these apply for your account.\n\nIt is the affiliates responsibility to provide a valid tax form within 30 days of a referral fee being earned. If the tax form has not been recorded, the referral fees will be forfeited and no payment will be issued.\n\nBecause of the high frequency of credit card and/or online account fraud and cancellation rates, we reserve the right to hold referral fees for up to 60 days for verification. We also reserve the right to cancel referral fees in the event that we are unable to collect funds, the order is fraudulent, the customer cancels within the first 30 days, or if we learn that the referral fee was earned improperly for any other reason.\n\nReferrals that issue a chargeback or are found to be fraudulent (false information, fake/stolen credit cards, selling counterfeit goods etc.) will be reversed regardless of the amount of time that has passed since the signup occurred.\n\nReferrals that cancel before you have met the $50 (50 USD) payout minimum will be reversed.\n\nMemberships using non-standard rates (rates not available through the affiliate program) are not eligible for affiliate referral fees. Non-standard rates include but are not limited to: sales, promotions, email offers, prepaid accounts and discounted pricing offered for educational, government, non-profit and charity organizations.\n\n\nAdvertising Compliance:\nAffiliates MAY NOT offer cash back, rewards or other incentives to drive traffic/sales via their affiliate tracking links.\n\nAffiliates MAY NOT use traffic that is generated by pay to click, pay to read, banner exchanges, click exchanges, CPV advertising, pop-up/under, SPAM, purchased traffic or similar methods.\n\nAffiliates MAY NOT use cookie stuffing techniques that set the tracking cookie without the user actually clicking on the referral link (for example a 1x1 pixel iframe).\n\nAffiliates MAY NOT bid on or use trademark, trademark +, or misspelled keywords for the purpose of PPC on Internet search engines (Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask etc.).\n\nAffiliates MAY NOT use trademark, trademark +, or misspelled keywords in their domain names.\n\nAffiliates are responsible for ensuring their tracking code is working properly before sending traffic to our servers. Any modification to the links is the sole responsibility of the affiliate. Referral fees will not be paid for tracking errors caused by editing, masking, redirecting or tampering with your links.\n\nThe use of redirected pages and links to send a user to our site is prohibited. Example: you may not have a PPC link on a search engine that redirects the user to our site.\n\nDomain forwarding is prohibited - you may not purchase a domain and set it to forward directly to our site using your affiliate link.\n\nAffiliates MAY NOT copy our website or portions of it and display them on their own site or subdomain.\n\nAffiliates MAY NOT engage in the advertisement of business-opportunity sites or use marketing practices that attract fraudulent or short-term customers (customers with low retention and renewal rates).\n\n\nFTC Disclosure Policy:\nIt is our intent to treat our customers fairly and comply fully with all Federal Trade Commission regulations related to advertising (See Endorsement Guides FN Notice for more information). As such, we require our affiliates to comply with these regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, which requires, among other criteria, that material connections between advertisers and endorsers be disclosed. This means that directories, review/rating sites, blogs and other websites, email or collateral that purport to provide an endorsement or assessment of an advertiser must prominently disclose financial or in-kind compensation is provided from the advertiser.\n\nWe reserve the right to withhold fees and/or cancel the affiliate relationship for failure to comply with the mentioned guide or other FTC regulations.\n\n\nDeactivation:\nAffiliate accounts may be deactivated at any time without warning or notice. Your account WILL BE DEACTIVATED and referral fees set to $0 for failure to comply with the Affiliate Terms and Advertising Compliance contained herein.\n\nAny false or misleading advertising or suspected fraudulent activity associated with your affiliate account will result in immediate deactivation.\n\nAffiliate accounts generating a large number of fraudulent accounts will be deactivated.\n\nAffiliates may not resell memberships. All clients must provide their own payment method and contact information to be eligible for affiliate referral fees.\n\nIf you would like to discontinue your affiliate status, simply remove your affiliate links and no longer promote them. For accounting purposes your account and personal information will not be removed from our system.\n\nBY REGISTERING AS AN AFFILIATE YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST DISCONTINUE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM, OR DEACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU ARE ALREADY A MEMBER.\n\nChanges to the Terms and Conditions apply to you.
